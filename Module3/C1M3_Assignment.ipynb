    "# Graded Lab : Tool Use and Reflective Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will explore how AI agents can enhance research workflows by leveraging external tools and engaging in critical self-reflection. You'll learn how to build and integrate callable tools—such as web and academic search functions, and connect them to a language model using OpenAI's tool-calling API. Then, you’ll guide the agent to not only generate content but also **reflect** on its own output, improving the quality and depth of the final report. By the end of this lab, you will have implemented a mini agent capable of searching, reasoning, and publishing structured reports in HTML—laying the foundation for more advanced multi-step and autonomous AI systems."

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a hybrid AI framework that bolsters large language models (LLMs) by combining them with external, up-to-date data sources. Instead of relying solely on static training data, RAG retrieves relevant documents at query time and feeds them into the model as context. This process flow helps developers update data sources without retraining the model and makes RAG a scalable and cost-effective solution for building LLM applications in domains like customer support, knowledge bases and internal search. This is called retrieval augmented generation (RAG), as you would retrieve the relevant data and use it as augmented context for the LLM. With RAG architecture, organizations can deploy any LLM model and augment it to return relevant results for their organization by giving it a small amount of their data without the costs and time of fine-tuning or pretraining the model.', 'url': 'https://www.databricks.com/glossary/retrieval-augmented-generation-rag'}\n",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is the process of optimizing the output of a large language model, so it references an authoritative knowledge base outside of its training data sources before generating a response. It redirects the LLM to retrieve relevant information from authoritative, pre-determined knowledge sources. Developers can also restrict sensitive information retrieval to different authorization levels and ensure the LLM generates appropriate responses. Without RAG, the LLM takes the user input and creates a response based on information it was trained on—or what it already knows. With RAG, an information retrieval component is introduced that utilizes the user input to first pull information from a new data source. Next, the RAG model augments the user input (or prompts) by adding the relevant retrieved data in context.

      "✅ Final answer:\n",
      "The investigation into radio observations of recurrent novae has garnered interest due to the unique insights it provides into nova explosions and the evolution of their shells over time. Here is a summary of relevant research in this area, focusing on the findings from recent studies.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Key Research and Findings\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Radio Observations of Classical and Recurrent Novae**:\n",
      "   - A study by Weston et al. (2013) provides an in-depth analysis of the nova V1723 Aql using radio observations. They observed an unexpected rapid rise in radio flux density and a distinct bump in the radio light curve, suggesting the presence of shocked material in the outer region of the ejected shell. This study illustrates how radio observations can shed light on the dynamics and mass loss history of novae [Weston et al., 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.2265v2).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Lessons from Recurrent Novae**:\n",
      "   - Mason and Walters (2013) discuss the spectral characteristics and evolution of recurrent novae like YY Dor and nova LMC 2009. The study highlights common features and suggests the presence of a similar white dwarf progenitor and post-outburst phases across different recurrent novae [Mason & Walters, 2013](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.2776v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Gamma-ray Follow-ups and Energetics in Novae**:\n",
      "   - López-Coto et al. (2015) focus on the follow-up observations of novae using the MAGIC telescopes to detect gamma-ray emissions. While they did not detect TeV gamma-ray emission, these observations help constrain the acceleration processes of leptons and hadrons during nova explosions [López-Coto et al., 2015](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.09170v1).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Importance of Radio Observations\n",
      "\n",
      "Radio observations are essential for understanding the mass ejection events during nova explosions. They enable the study of the evolving structure and density profile of the ejected shell, providing insights into both the physical conditions and processes at play. The advancements in radio telescopes, such as the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), have significantly enhanced the ability to capture detailed radio light curves, facilitating a better understanding of nova phenomena.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Challenges and Future Prospects\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the progress made, challenges remain in interpreting radio data, such as distinguishing between thermal and non-thermal emissions and accounting for environmental influences. Future observations with next-generation radio telescopes will likely provide even more detailed insights, influencing models of nova outbursts and aiding in the precise estimation of ejecta mass and kinetic energy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Understanding recurrent novae through radio emissions continues to be a vital puzzle piece in the broader picture of stellar evolution and explosion mechanics in binary star systems.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Implement `reflection_and_rewrite(report)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, your goal is to develop a function that takes a report, analyzes it, generates a structured reflection, and produces an improved version of the report. This involves two main tasks: crafting a precise prompt and setting up a correctly configured response call to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Create a User Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Objective**: Guide the language model to output a structured response in JSON format.\n",
    "- **Format**: Ensure the output includes two keys, `\"reflection\"` and `\"revised_report\"`.\n",
    "- **Details**: Your reflection should cover strengths, limitations, suggestions, and opportunities. The revised report should incorporate these elements to improve clarity and academic tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Configure the Response Call\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Use the specified model (e.g., `\"gpt-4o-mini\"`) and set the temperature equal to the `temperature` parameter of the graded function.\n",
    "- **Structure**: Make sure the response setup directs the model properly, ensuring the JSON format is adhered to without additional commentary.\n",
    "\n",
